# Todos

 - Add more Component Unit Test Cases (Services test cases done)
 - Apply retry logic based on https://angular.io/guide/practical-observable-usage#exponential-backoff
 - Fix Parameter Encoding (for example, right now Chinese character based tags won't work)
 - jsonFlickrFeed (function wrapper around data) from Flickr removed in a hacky way - need to improvise on that
 - There is scope for optimizations and code refactoring
 - Common array/string operations can be done using lodash
 - PublicFeedComponent and Service can be refactored out in a feature module and lazily loaded using loadChildren - currently not done being the only module
